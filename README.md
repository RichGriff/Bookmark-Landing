## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

My main focus on completing this project was to practice my skills and knowledge around Next Js and Tailwindcss (without having to design). One of the main features I really enjoyed working on in this project was the Features section, making use of State in React and updating the rendering component based on the selected feature.  

### Continued development

For continued development I would take this frontend and attach it to some sort of Content Management System. This would allow users to make updates for their content when needed. I would take the JAMStack approach, using a headless CMS (such as Sanity.io).

### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Tailwindcss Docs is extremely useful trying to figure out the best styles to use, easy to find what you need.
